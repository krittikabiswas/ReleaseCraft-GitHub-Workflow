    <h3>✨ This is what my repo is about👺:-</h3>
    A hands-on exploration of how real teams ship software using a *release-based workflow* ❄️  which is
    built on top of the GitHub Flow that actually captures my work of creating releases, tagging versions, managing features, adding hotfixes, and packaging a project like an actual dev team ig😉. Thought of why not explore these things being bored at home after coming back from hostel for a couple of days to eat "Pithe"😋 made by my dad💪!!

## Go ahead and READDDDD What Happened in This Repo👺👺:-

- 🏷️ Created **tags** & published a **beta release**  
- 🎨 Added a **new feature** using a short-lived branch  
- 🔀 Opened a **release pull request**  
- 📝 Auto-generated & customized **release notes**  
- 🎉 Finalized the **v1.0 release**  
- 🐞 Added a **hotfix** for an issue  
- 📦 Published **v1.0.1** as the stable release  

All tiny steps—but but yeah, together they build an entire workflow teams actually use ✨

## 🧠 My Repo Represents_-

- Understanding how teams structure releases  
- Practicing GitFlow + Release Flow together  
- Keeping code organized across branches  
- Managing features without breaking main  
- Shipping clean, versioned builds  

This was a small kinda project but gave big clarity (yk self-satisfaction📈)🤌

## 📌 Why Release-Based Workflows?

Because real-world software is shipped in **versions**.  
And this workflow makes it easy to:

- Group features 🎯  
- Track changes cleanly 🧹  
- Patch bugs without chaos 🐛  
- Give users downloadable builds 📦

## 🧩 Final Thoughts👊🏻👊🏻

This repo was my tiny playground for me to explore and learn how releases actually work on GitHub — tagging, branching, fixing, merging, versioning… all the good stuff 💛  

More experiments I'm gonna be doing ofc 
Stay tuned, (future dev? I'm not sure.... but crazy, and slightly immature Krittika😭) Aay Aay Captain🤭!!!
